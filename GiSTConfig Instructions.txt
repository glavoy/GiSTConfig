To do:
 - Allow spreadsheet to have additional rows that are not questions (Rows that are not questions, must be merged (except first row))
 - Allow user to select spreadsheet rather than hard-coding it
 - Add functionality to create xml files for each worksheet in an Excel spreadsheet
 - Allow user to choose folder where to save the xml files and the database
 - Create a table in the MS Access for each worksheet in the Excel spreadsheet
 - Add checks to the software to verify the integrity of the Excel spreadsheet, including:
	- if upper range has a number, then lower range must also have a number
	- make sure there are no empty fieldnames - especially at the end of the file
	- ensure no duplicate fieldnames
	- ensure QuestionType, FieldName, FieldType are valid types
	- ensure DontKnow.Refuse.NA only contain 'TRUE' or blank
